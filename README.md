### test.js (container config done)
The .devcontainer/devcontainer.yml file is automatically created because it's the core config that tells GitHub Codespaces how to build and set up your Node.js development environment in a container. Without it, Codespaces wouldn't know what tools, image, or settings to apply.
### datatypes.js
Question:
Is JavaScript a statically or a dynamically typed language?

Quick answer:
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, but TypeScript is a statically typed language.

Longer answer:
In dynamically typed languages all type checks are performed in a runtime, only when your program is executing. So this means you can just assign anything you want to the variable and it will work.
