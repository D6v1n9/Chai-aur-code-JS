# Javascript and classes 
### Do javascript really have classes 
Yes, JavaScript does have classes. This feature was introduced with the ECMAScript 2015 specification (often referred to as ES6). 
However, it's important to note that JavaScript is primarily a ***prototype-based language***, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar 
over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. In other words, it provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from
class-based languages such as Java or C++, but under the hood, it works somewhat differently.

especially for large or complex software systems.
